# Samurai Shodown V Special Frame Dojo

Samurai Shodown (known colloquially as SamSho) is a 2D fighting game with a long history and methodical gameplay. Samurai Shodown V Special was the last video game released for the NeoGeo, but saw a small revival when ported to the Playstation 4 and PC. The game has a slightly reduced focus on complicated inputs and more focus on testing your opponent and predicting what they might do, then reacting with a move.

Here's some gameplay from the yearly tournament Combo Breaker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZl9lk--iD0
